### :pencil: About this project
- This project is owned by [@harshfeudal](https://github.com/harshfeudal). You can join my Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/BAk2CXpRAT)!
- This respiratory is under-construction! I'll update it as soon as possible.
- I'm not highly recommended you to use C++ to code a Discord bot, instead of JavaScript or others library. To know how's this project works, you should learn some basics about C++ so that you can know what I am doing.

### 📚 Libraries and version
These are libraries that we're using in this project:
- [Dpp](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP) - version `10.0.20` (latest)
- [Spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) - version `1.10.0` (latest)

Bot current version: 
- BETA version - `0.1.2.106` (`Release` Version)
- Stable version - `Unknown`

### 🚨 Generating and using
 This project was made by Visual Studio, so basically you cannot see my `.sln` file to open because I have ignored it. To use this project, you should generate it by using [Premake](https://premake.github.io/).

 So basically, I have written `premake5.lua` for generating it (still working with that file, I'll finish it ASAP). Here are these steps:
 1. Download `premake5.exe` from [their website](https://premake.github.io/)
 2. Open the correct folder that you've downloaded this project, put that `premake5.exe` file into this project (put that file where you can see the `Raiden Shogun.rc` located)
 3. On the navigation bar, for example `D:/Harshfeudal/Raiden Shogun/`, clear all and type `cmd` on that, then enter and the terminal will release
 4. On that terminal, type:
 ```
 $ premake5 vs<add_their_version_here_without_bracelets>
 ```
 If you're using Visual Studio 2022 like me, just do like this:
 ```
 $ premake5 vs2022
 ```
 5. Open it, build and run. And enjoy!

 ### :computer: Contribution and Pull Request
  I'd probably glad to see if you have anything new to help and support me. To do that, please make a pull request and before you request a new pull request, make sure that you've tested the code by using your bot. I won't bite you if you do wrong, but just make sure that you need to test it clearly before I merge it.
